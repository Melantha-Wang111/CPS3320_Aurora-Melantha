# Answer to the question list:

# Q3: if the part begins with "# Personally written", it means this part is coded by ourselves and others are imported from other resources.

# Q4: Data Preprocessing
#       Before we put the image into the program, we select images of the licence plate, which has normal shape as a rectangle. Hence, we randomly select 10 iamges from the google image abd sent to the program to get the recognization result. 

# Q5: list of websites used in codingï¼š
#       Usage for cv2 function: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-opencv-cv2-imshow-method/
#       Find cooordinates of contours using opencv: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-co-ordinates-of-contours-using-opencv-python/
#       Usage for pytesseract function: https://nanonets.com/blog/ocr-with-tesseract/

# Q6: Accuracy: Based on the accuracy of each image after recognition, we calculated an average accuracy of the dataset is 72.89%
